## FAQ

Q: In the React Crash course section, where do you get the `js/lib/react.min.js` and `js/lib/react-dom.min.js` files from?  
A: For all of the files in this example, I pulled the source from [https://unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com). It's essentially a CDN that allows you to easily load any file from any npm package. While node.js uses the commonJS format to load files / modules and webpack now supports commonJS as well, before webpack and browserify it was common to use the UMD / AMD format. In a nutshell it basically means there is a production-ready version of the library that is bundled as 1 file. You can read [more on commonJS vs AMD vs UMD here](https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/). So for most npm packages that can be loaded in a browser, you can use [https://unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) to get a standalone file that you can manually copy in (if you aren't using webpack etc) by typically looking in the the `umd` or `dist` folder.

Examples:
```
https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/umd/react.production.min.js
https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.0.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js
https://unpkg.com/redux@3.7.2/dist/redux.min.js
```
